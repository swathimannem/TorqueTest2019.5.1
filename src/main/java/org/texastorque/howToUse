This starts from something basic that works for sure, and then works its way up to a potentially 
    working swerve drive.

How to uncomment in order: 
    - ctrl+f comments following the pattern of number_comment (ex: 1_comment) and uncomment those lines in 
    numerical order or do as said in this file in that location in the code
    - find the same comment in this file and see if it is doing/outputting what it is supposed to
    - all pertinent lines are marked with the same comment for ease of access

    - smart dashboard should output the correct degree of the left joystick, pressing all the way up should
    be 0, right should be 90, down should be 180, left should be 270
    - if not working, the toBearing method needs to be modified so that it does work 
    - potential problem: Math.atan2() and null values for x and y if translation in purely that direction
